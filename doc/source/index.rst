Ansys SCADE Python Wrapper

This tool provides a Python proxy to a SCADE Suite or Scade One application.
It allows running the application in regular batch mode, or using

  * SCADE Suite Code Generator extension
  * SCADE Suite Custom Extension: Settings page for the wrapper

  Refer to the Section *Generating Integration Code from SCADE Suite*, in the
  document *SCADE Products API Resources* of the SCADE Suite documentation,
  for a complete reference of SCADE Code Generator extensions, also known as
  wrappers.

* Scade One (2024 R2)
  * Command-line tool
