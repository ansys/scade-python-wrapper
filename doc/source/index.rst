Ansys SCADE Python Wrapper
==========================

This tool provides a Python proxy to a SCADE Suite application.
It allows running the application in regular batch mode, or using
SCADE Suite white box co-simulation, through ``SsmSlaveLib.c`` services.

The package supports SCADE Suite 2021 R2 and greater, and is made of the
following components:

* SCADE Suite Code Generator extension
* SCADE Suite Custom Extension: Settings page for the wrapper

Refer to the section *Generating Integration Code from SCADE Suite*, in the
document *SCADE Python API Guide* of the SCADE Suite documentation,
for a complete reference of SCADE Code Generator extensions, also known as
wrappers.
